# Home-Automation
IoT home improves convenience, security, and enery efficiency, making homes smarter and more efficient.
This repo contains some major IoT home automation files including Microcontroller Schematics, firmware and PCB designs.
Some of the Key features in this repository include:
1.  Central Hub design: Uisng ESP32 microcontroller, a PCB was designed for a temperature & humidity sensor module that communicates with the central hub to pass across data of the sensor. 
2.  Automation & Control for Lighting: A circuit was designed using Arduino to control LED strip based on ambient light levels using an LDR sensor. This circuit was designed using Proteus 8 professional software and simulated as well.
3.  Security: A Motion Security feature was implemented using PIR motion sensor to trigger an alarm system when motion is detected. simulated and designed using Proteus.
4.  Energy Management: It optimize power consumption for the device by implementing Sleep modes.

NOTE: All codes(Firmware) is written in C++ using Arduino IDE. The schematic designs and Simulations are carried out using Proteus 8 professional software. The PCB design was carried out using KICAD software.
