Home Automation using the internet of Things (IOT) enables remote monitoring and control of household devices via the internet. IOT-based home automation systems use sensors, actuators, microcontrollers (like ESP32, Raspberry Pi), and Wireless communication protocols (WIFI, MQTT) to automate tasks such as lighting, temperature control, security and energy management.

For this Project, there are compilation of home automation key features such as:
1. Lighting Automation & Scheduling
2. Security such as Motion Sensors
3. Cloud Integration such as MQTT and WiFi
4. Energy Efficiency

IoT home automation improves convenience, security, and energy efficiency, making modern homes smarter and more efficient.
