This is a PCB design for a Temperature Sensor Module that can Communicate with a central Hub.
For this Project, i used KICAD Software to design the Schematic diagram for the project and also PCB design.

List of Components:
1. DHT11 sensor module
2. ESP32 Micro-controller
3. Resistors 
4. Capacitors
5. Battery Connector case

The FirmWare for this Project was written in C++ using Arduino IDE. The Firmware connects to a cloud server via MQTT.
